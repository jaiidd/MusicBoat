## What You Need to Do:
Commands are currently being deployed to servers, which may take a few minutes to complete. During this time, some commands might not work properly and may display an error such as “Unknown integration.” This is normal while the syncing process is still ongoing. If you encounter this issue, please wait a few minutes and then restart your Discord client; this typically resolves the problem once the commands have fully synced.
