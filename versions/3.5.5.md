# Update 3.5.5 (07/27/25)  
Hey everyone! We just rolled out a fresh update for **@MusicBoat♪♪#4421** – and it's looking better than ever.  
> We've cleaned things up, made features easier to use, and gave the bot a small makeover!  
> :warning: *Heads up: due to a database migration, some user data (listening time, top songs, and top server) and server settings were reset. Playlists were not affected.*
## What’s New in v3.5.5
### A Fresh Look  
- **Updated Profile** – New avatar, cleaner interface, and better organized commands. Just a little polish to make your experience smoother.  
- **Easier Navigation** – We’ve simplified how you access settings like filters, looping, song selection, and custom playlists. Everything’s just a bit more intuitive now.  
- **Smarter Help & Setup** – Need help? The help and setup commands now highlight the most important info first.
### Fixes & Improvements  
- Faster response times when using commands  
- Bot now joins the correct voice channel more reliably after restarts (`24/7 mode`)  
- General stability and bug fixes across the board  
### Removed & Fixed Commands  
- **Removed**: `/setup` Request channel is temporarily gone while we improve it.
- **Removed Filters** 
     - `/3d`, `/chipmunk`, `/deep`, `/earwax`, `/echo`, `/fast`, `/flanger`, `/gate`, `/haas`, `/mcompand`, `/phaser`, `/slow`, `/surround`
- **Filter Replacements**
     - `8d`, `/channelmix`, `/distortion`, `/rotation`, `/slowmode`, `/timescale`
- **Disabled**: `/autoplay` Being reworked for a better experience.
- **Fixed**: `/pl-play` it’s now easier to find and play your playlists.
- **Fixed**: `/pl-manage` – Managing playlists is now smoother and more reliable.
### Important Info  
We recently moved to a new database to help the bot scale better in the future.  
As part of that, **some user and server data had to be wiped** (like volume presets or saved queues). We're sorry for the inconvenience — but this change will help things run much smoother going forward.
